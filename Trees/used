Many problems don’t mention trees, but if the data has nodes + children/branches, you should think in terms of tree/graph traversal.
in this q: https://leetcode.com/problems/employee-importance/description/?envType=problem-list-v2&envId=tree


//CREATE TREE FROM PARENT ARRAY

        TreeNode[] nodes = new TreeNode[n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
            nodes[i] = new TreeNode(i); //first create node 

        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            int p = parents[i];
            if (nodes[p].left == null)
                nodes[p].left = nodes[i];
            else
                nodes[p].right = nodes[i];
        }
