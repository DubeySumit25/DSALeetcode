// ✅ Create a list to store both element value and its original index
List<int[]> paired = new ArrayList<>();

for (int i = 0; i < arr.size(); i++) {
    // Each entry stores: [value, index]
    paired.add(new int[] { arr.get(i), i });
}

/*
🔁 Purpose:
We’re pairing each element with its index because we want 
a two-way relationship — we can access:
   ➤ value using index
   ➤ index using value
Unlike a normal Map, which is one-directional (key → value only),
this structure allows sorting or processing while keeping track
of original positions, like in Tree or sorting problems.
