If problem asks about :
Asks about number or word
Each digit or character can be changed in same way
You have to reach a target word/number
In minimum steps/moves/operations
find the max/min of those states
often leads to finite number of states/nodes
** it is graph traversal problem ** for traveral we can use BFS/DFS 
as BFS helps in shortest path so if asked reach target in min numbers we will do /*BFS*/
but sometimes BFS DFS both can work in problem
Example of such problems:
Min Genetic Mutation
Open the Lock
Word Ladder 1 and 2
Sliding Puzzle
